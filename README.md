# DeltaEngine

DeltaEngine is a Python-based tool designed to enhance system clock synchronization features and offer time management tools specifically for Windows devices. With DeltaEngine, you can synchronize your system clock, set the system time, and perform other time-related operations.

## Features

- **System Clock Synchronization**: Synchronize your Windows system clock to ensure accurate timekeeping.
- **Set System Time**: Adjust the system time on Windows devices.
- **Time Management**: Add or subtract time from the current system time for testing purposes.
- **Track Time Elapsed**: Monitor the time elapsed since the program started.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows Operating System
- Administrative privileges (required for setting system time)
- [Optional] Virtual environments recommended for dependency management

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/delta-engine.git
cd delta-engine
```

## Usage

Run the `delta_engine.py` script:

```bash
python delta_engine.py
```

This will synchronize your system clock, adjust time by adding 120 seconds, and print the time elapsed since the program started.

## Important Notes

- **Windows Only**: The current implementation supports only Windows platforms due to the use of Windows-specific APIs.
- **Administrative Privileges**: Modifying the system clock requires administrative privileges. Ensure you run the script with appropriate permissions.
- **Disclaimer**: Use this tool responsibly. Changing the system time can affect time-sensitive applications and system processes.
